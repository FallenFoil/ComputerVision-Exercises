# Computer Vision Exercises

Three Computer Vision exercises.

## Part 1

### Exercise 1

- Introduce noise in the image
- Smoothing using average, Gaussian or median filters in spatial domain
- Compute the Discrete Fast Fourier Transform (DFT)
- Smoothing using Butterworth and Gaussian filters in frequency domain

### Exercise 2

- Develop the Canny Edge detection:
  - Smoothing
  - Calculate magnitude and orientation
  - Apply NonMax
  - double_hysteresis thresholding
  
## Part 2
  
- Identify the number of coins in an image
